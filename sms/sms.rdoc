= Building an SMS Server

Using Ruby, we're going to learn how to build something that we can use to quickly send SMS messages.

== Why SMS?

* Usage is exploding in the states.  Many people would rather communicate this way rather than actually talking.  It's quick and it's impersonal and it's great for quickly notifying people.  

* Supported by almost all mobile phones.  If your phone doesn't support SMS then I think its time you purchase a new phone and get rid of your slap bracelet collection.

== SMS Limitations

* Not everybody has a smart phone.  Text messages should be no more than 160 characters.

* Blasting somebody with a constant stream of text messages can end up costing them an arm and a leg.  Don't do this -- unless it's actually what you intended on doing ...

== Sending SMS

* There are several gems available that we can use for SMS delivery

* Not all of them are completely free solutions

* Clickatell is a very popular SMS gateway.  If you have an account there and don't mind paying per message sent, this is the best solution for you.  

* SMS Fu is a free solution that uses e-mail to SMS as a means to deliver free messages.

== SMS Fu

* SMS Fu allows for free outbound SMS.  

* It's available as a gem and it's really easy to use.  Too easy.

* It relies on e-mail to SMS to deliver messages.

== Problems with SMS Fu

* One of the biggest problems with SMS Fu is that you need to know your recipient's carrier.  Unlike Clickatell, you actually have to pass in the carrier name to send a text message.

* There are many supported carriers but not as much as Clickatell.

* It needs to use ActionMailer to deliver text messages.

== How Does it Work?

Say we have a phone number we want to send a text message to.  

We know this individual's number is 555-867-5309 and that they're using AT&T.  

If we've ever e-mailed ourselves using SMS we can see that a message from them will come from:

  5558675309@txt.att.net
  
We can easily break this down now.  We have the number at the front and at the end of the address 
we have the SMS e-mail address.  This very address can be used to send SMS messages to them as well.

This is how SMS Fu works.
