= Building an Asteroids Clone with Gosu

Using Ruby, Gosu, and pure awesomeness, we're going to build a clone of Atari's 1979 classic, Asteroids.

This guide assumes that you're using OSX but should be approximately the same for Linux/Windows.

== Install Gosu

Follow the instructions for RUBY here:

  http://code.google.com/p/gosu/wiki/GettingStartedOnLinux
  http://code.google.com/p/gosu/wiki/GettingStartedOnWindows

== Test Gosu Installation

Create a folder for your project:

  mkdir asteroids
  cd asteroids

Copy the gosu bundle to your project:

  cp /opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/gosu-0.7.23-universal-darwin/lib/gosu.for_1_8.bundle .

Create the initial file for your game:

  touch game.rb

Make it executable

  chmod +x game.rb

Edit game.rb to inclue the following:

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby -w

  require 'gosu.for_1_8.bundle'

  class GameWindow < Gosu::Window
    def initialize
      super(640, 480, false)
    end
  end

  window = GameWindow.new
  window.show

Run the file:

  ./game.rb

You should see a blank window. If you do, you're ready to go!
